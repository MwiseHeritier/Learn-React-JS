<!--
  REACT
  -----
  -> Def: React is external library that help us create website easier.
  -> it's a bunch of code that is outside our computer.
  -> We can load this code on our website, and use it.
  -> When using React, we use JSX instead of normal JavaScript.
  ->  Using React we can actually use our own HTML element and we use our own 
  HTML element to build a website.
  -> In React, we should not modify the data directly. we should always create 
  a copy and then modify that copy, this helps React to be more efficient
  -> Do not use the DOM manually bcz React is managing the website, if we use DOM 
  manually it might interfere with React Instead we should use React features to get 
  the text from a textbox.


  Why are there 2 external libraries for React?
  ---------------------------------------------
  -> React can be used in different places like Websites and Mobile apps.
  -> Creators of react decided to devided into 3 external libraries these are:
  1. React = shared features(used in both websites and mobile apps)
  2. ReactDOM = features specific to websites(using React to create websites ).
  3. ReactNative = using React to create mobile apps.

  -> ReactDOM.createRoot() = sets up React.
  -> .render() = display something inside the container
  
  container
  ---------
  -> This element act as the container.
  -> Everything we create with react is going to be displayed in  container.
  -> the reason Reacts uses this is because it keep things orgnized, everything in this
  container is going to be controlled by React and will not affect other elements outside.
  
  BABEL EXTERNAL LIBRARY
  ----------------------
  ->Def: Babel is a JavaScript compiler â€” it takes modern JavaScript (ES6, ES7, JSX, etc.) 
  and converts it into an older version  of JavaScript(normal JavaScript) that browsers can understand.
 ->Babel is an external JavaScript library that compiles modern JavaScript (and JSX)
  into browser-compatible JavaScript.

 -> Translates other languages into JS.

  JSX
  ---
  -> means Javascript XML
  -> Same as Javascript, but we can write HTML directly in our Jascript code.
  -> Let us find errors easier when we are coding.
  -> We can insert values inside JSX elements.
  -> Creating a website with React feels natural it is simpe than how we  create DOM feature in JS.
  ->JSX is more strict than normal HTML , all element need a closing tag.

  type='text/babel'
  ----------------
  ->This attribute tells babel to translate all code inside the script into the normal javascript.
